# PY-PROJECT-DIG-CLOCK
**Digital Clock using Python and Tkinter**

This is a simple digital clock application built with Python and the Tkinter library. It displays the current time in the format 'HH:MM:SS AM/PM' and updates the time every second.

**Features:**
- Real-time digital clock with seconds precision.
- Time displayed in 12-hour format (AM/PM).

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

**Usage:**
1. Clone the repository or download the `digital_clock.py` file.
2. Run the Python script `digital_clock.py` using the following command:
   ```
   python digital_clock.py
   ```
3. The digital clock window will open, displaying the current time.

**Customization:**
- You can modify the font, font size, and colors to change the appearance of the digital clock.
- To update the time format or add additional information (e.g., date), modify the `strftime` function in the `time()` function.
- For a more unique clock, you can add additional features like weather information or animation.
